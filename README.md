The goal of this project is finding the most repeated words in each different languages. In this I don't want to focus only on official texts; so unofficial and conversational texts are important too.
Now I began with finding the most repeated words in Farsi (my native language that also called Persian). for collecting the words I used RSS feed of 171 blogs.
The result of reading the feed was 743646 words and 55442 unique words.
I stored all words and unique words in two SQL table that you can access theme in Farsi forlder, also for ease I stored top 100 and top 500 most repeated Farsi word in two files.
